    # I don't have any heating element built in so it is just the heat exchanger and ventilation
    # Thus, I enable the heat exchanger for "heating", basically by setting WRG bypass to 00 (i.e. summer mode at 0°C)
    # and use heating_mode to control the bypass status (when heating_mode is on the heat exchanger turns on too, it can't be individually controlled)

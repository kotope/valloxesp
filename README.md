# Configuration
See guide at https://www.creatingsmarthome.com/?p=105

## Breaking changes
Configuration is no longer possible by using configurations.yaml. Please use UI configuration from integrations!

If you have old configuration in configurations.yaml, please remove it and make a new configuration through UI.
